## â›… Overview

This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef).

### The challenge
- Build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- The users should be able to see hover states for all interactive elements on the page and view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.

As a personal challenge, I decided to use and learn SASS for the first time, it was very fun and I learned a lot. I intend to study it further and, in the next challenges, use more of the functionalities available.
